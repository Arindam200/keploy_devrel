# Developer Relations @ Keploy
> Evangelism / Enablement / Advocacy / Community

We believe that developers deserve a stress-free and enjoyable testing experience, and our goal is to make Keploy the go-to platform for automated service testing. We're dedicated to fostering a vibrant and supportive community where developers can learn, connect, and share their knowledge.

## Here's what we do:

- Evangelism: We spread the word about Keploy and its benefits through various channels, including conferences, workshops, webinars, and online communities.
- Enablement: We provide developers with the resources and tools they need to get started with Keploy and use it effectively. This includes documentation, tutorials, code examples, and support channels.
- Advocacy: We listen to the needs of the community and advocate for features and improvements that will make Keploy the best possible tool for developers.
- Community: We build and nurture a thriving community of Keploy users through online forums, social media groups, and events.

## Get Involved!

The Keploy ecosystem is diverse, and we encourage you to get involved in various ways:

### 🫂 Monthly Community Call

Join us every month from 6 PM - 7 PM IST!

We host a monthly community call to provide a platform for Keploy users to connect, discuss, and share experiences. The call is scheduled every month from 6 PM to 7 PM IST. This is a great opportunity to stay updated, ask questions, and contribute ideas for discussion.

### 📙 Docs

Our documentation is the primary way to communicate with our users. You can contribute by fixing typos, rewriting sections, or adding new content. Think of it as an open-source deployment automation wiki, and you are the curator.

### 🚀 Code

Keploy has implementations across multiple languages. If you find a bug or need a new feature, every Keploy repository is open-source, with a contributing guide to help you get started. If you're building your own Keploy tooling, let us know – we'd love to showcase it.

### 📝 Blogs, Videos & Articles

Keep our reading list vibrant by adding your favorite content about deployment automation.

### 🎉 Events

Share your meetups or events on Slack and add them to our list.

### 👥 Helping those in the community
